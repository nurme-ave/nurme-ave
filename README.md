# Hi there üëã I'm Ave - Frontend Developer. I build low-carbon websites üåçüå±üåø.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My career shift into tech has been an incredible journey of growth and discovery. From writing my first line of code to becoming a certified developer and technical trainer, I've worked from agile startups to established companies like Telia. But here's what really drives me: creating websites that don't just look beautiful and perform flawlessly - they also leave a lighter footprint on our planet.

My coding journey began with Python, where I discovered the joy of problem-solving through programming. As my passion for web development grew, I naturally gravitated toward React and Next.js, finding the component-based architecture intuitive and powerful. More recently, I've been exploring Svelte, and I'm genuinely excited about its elegant approach to building reactive interfaces with less complexity.

Beyond coding, I'm deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of developers. There's something magical about helping someone realize they can reinvent their professional life through code.

When I step away from the screen, I love exploring scenic routes by bicycle - whether outdoors discovering new paths or indoors following virtual routes across iconic bridges over the Atlantic Ocean at sunset, complete with rolling mist banks, or through real countryside. There's something about the rhythm of pedaling that sparks my best ideas.

## üìÖ 100DaysOfCode Journey

I completed the #100DaysOfCode challenge twice in 2020 and in May 2022 I completed my 3rd round.

It teaches you consistency which is a powerful tool if you wish to be really good at something. As I was documenting my progress in social media (my channel for that was Twitter) it also helped me to grow my network and I gained quite valuable connections.

I am planning to start my 4th round in 2025. I'm thinking of taking on a whole new framework but we'll see :).

## üéì Mentoring Experience

### 1. Harvard's CS50
In January 2021 I had the opportunity to volunteer as a mentor in a few Python live seminars organized by the CS50 staff at Harvard University. This was a very unique experience as I did it in real-time when those seminars took place.

I had to be quick in catching questions from the students and answering them as there were a lot of students all around the world attending. It was quite an adrenaline rush! Everyone should get out of their comfort zone every once in a while and take on new challenges.

The heart and soul of the CS50 course is Harvard's very own professor David J. Malan. His teaching style is genuinely captivating. I would advise any beginner (and not only) to take Harvard's CS50 courses.

### 2. Treehouse
My journey in tech got started at Treehouse with Python. They had a genuinely supportive online community there where I myself sought for assistance and I also gave advice to other students. Overall I helped out a bit over 50 students. It felt so rewarding to get positive feedback from the students I helped!

You can see examples of my answers to questions students asked at the Treehouse Community (Python) at my homepage [avenurme.dev](https://www.avenurme.dev/mentoring).

### 3. My Mentees
I have 3 awesome students (mentees) to mentor. Two of them are from Denmark and one is from Germany. I was reached out by them on Twitter (currently known as X) and as I have experience mentoring students new to coding before, I was happy to jump on this opportunity.

Mentoring is definitely something that I hold close to my heart and it is a two-way street since mentees help the mentor to keep their skills sharp and up-to-date.

My awesome mentees are all career shifters, and as I transitioned into tech from a whole other field myself I can relate to them quite significantly. So this alone was a great starting platform for us.

My mission is to help my mentees make their landing into the tech world as smooth as possible. I help them with their studies and coding assignments, also giving them code reviews. We have our own dedicated Discord channel and we also hold virtual meetings whenever needed.
