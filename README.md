# Hi there üëã I'm Ave - Frontend Developer. Building a faster, greener web and mentoring new devs on their journey üåçüå±üåø.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

My career shift into tech has been an incredible journey of growth and discovery. From writing my first line of code to becoming a certified developer and technical trainer, I've worked from agile startups to established companies like Telia. But here's what really drives me: creating websites that don't just look beautiful and perform flawlessly - they also leave a lighter footprint on our planet.

My coding journey began with Python, where I discovered the joy of problem-solving through programming. As my passion for web development grew, I naturally gravitated toward React and Next.js, finding the component-based architecture intuitive and powerful. More recently, I've been exploring Svelte, and I'm genuinely excited about its elegant approach to building reactive interfaces with less complexity.

Beyond coding, I'm deeply committed to mentoring the next generation of developers. There's something magical about helping someone realize they can reinvent their professional life through code.

When I step away from the screen, I love exploring scenic routes by bicycle - whether outdoors discovering new paths or indoors following virtual routes across iconic bridges over the Atlantic Ocean at sunset, complete with rolling mist banks, or through real countryside. There's something about the rhythm of pedaling that sparks my best ideas. You can find my full cycling story and stats here [avenurme.dev](https://www.avenurme.dev/cycling).

## üìÖ 100DaysOfCode Journey

What started as a personal challenge became a life-changing habit. I've completed this journey three times (2x in 2020 and 1x in 2022), and each round taught me something different about persistence, growth, and the power of showing up daily.

Beyond the obvious skill improvements, this challenge builds something invaluable: unshakeable consistency. It's the difference between developers who dream about projects and those who ship them.

The magic isn't just in the code you write - it's in the consistency that rewires your brain. Documenting my progress on Twitter opened doors I never expected, connecting me with developers worldwide, and leading to opportunities that shaped my career.

Ready for round #4 in 2025? I'm considering tackling something completely different. Because the best part of this journey isn't the destination - it's discovering your potential along the way.

## üéì Mentoring Journey

### 1. Harvard's CS50: Live Mentoring Sessions
Picture this: hundreds of aspiring developers from around the globe, all logged in simultaneously, questions flying faster than you can read them. That was my reality as a volunteer mentor for Harvard's CS50 Python seminars in January 2021.

The adrenaline was real. One moment I'm helping someone debug their first loop, the next I'm explaining why their code works but could be cleaner. There's something magical about that split-second when you see understanding click for someone on the other side of the world.

Each answer had to be quick, clear, and encouraging. You learn to type fast when someone's coding breakthrough depends on your next message.

During those live January 2021 sessions, I wasn't just answering Python questions. I was witnessing dozens of career changers, students, and curious minds take their first real steps into programming. The energy was infectious.

The heart and soul of the CS50 course is Harvard's very own professor David J. Malan. His ability to make complex concepts feel approachable isn't just impressive - it's transformative. If you're considering diving into programming, CS50 isn't just recommended - it's essential.

### 2. Treehouse Community: Where I Found My Voice
Treehouse didn't just teach me Python - it taught me the power of community. What started as my own searches for help ("Why won't this loop work?!") evolved into something I never expected: becoming the person others turned to for answers.

The Treehouse community was different. Real people, real struggles, real breakthroughs. I found myself spending hours crafting responses, not because I had to, but because I remembered exactly how it felt to be stuck on that same problem just weeks before.

53 students later (yes, I kept count), each "Thank you, that finally clicked!" message hit different. There's something addictive about being the bridge between confusion and that lightbulb moment. Those late-night forum posts weren't just about debugging code - they were about debugging careers, dreams, and the limiting belief that "I'm just not a tech person."

Treehouse showed me that the best way to solidify your own learning is to teach someone else. Every question I answered made me a better developer, but more importantly, it made me realize that mentoring wasn't just something I was meant to do - it was something I was meant to do.

You can see examples of my answers to questions students asked at the Treehouse Community (Python) at my homepage [avenurme.dev](https://www.avenurme.dev/mentoring#mentoring-treehouse).

### 3. My Mentees: Paying It Forward
From individual mentees to teaching the world: what started as helping career changers on Treehouse has evolved into something bigger. Today, I work as a technical trainer, teaching different technologies to groups of 25 students from around the globe.

There's something magical about watching 25 different stories unfold simultaneously. Most of my students are career shifters - just like I was - and that shared experience of reinventing yourself professionally creates an instant bond. We understand the doubt, the imposter syndrome, the late-night debugging sessions, and most importantly, the incredible rush when everything finally clicks.

Every cohort has its own personality. Some groups are chatty and collaborative, others are quietly determined. But they all share that hunger to transform their lives through code. When each course ends, there's always a bittersweet moment - we've become a community, and saying goodbye is never easy.

The emails that follow are pure gold. "I got the job!" "I shipped my first feature!" "Thank you for believing in me when I didn't believe in myself." Those messages remind me why I fell in love with mentoring in the first place: it's not just about teaching code - it's about unlocking human potential.
